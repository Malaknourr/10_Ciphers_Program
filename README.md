## About the Project 

This program was developed as an educational tool to demonstrate fundamental encryption techniques used throughout history. Each cipher represents an important milestone in cryptography:

- **Historical Ciphers**: Atbash (Hebrew), Caesar variants, Vigenère (16th century)
- **Modern Fundamentals**: XOR (basis of modern cryptography)
- **Encoding Schemes**: Morse code, Baconian steganography

The implementation balances historical accuracy with practical usability, making it perfect for:
- Cryptography students
- Security enthusiasts
- Puzzle solvers
- Anyone interested in secret communications
